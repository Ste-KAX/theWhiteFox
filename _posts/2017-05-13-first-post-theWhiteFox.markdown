This is my first post and is the second redesign & rebuild of my site. A merge of two sites, one HTML5 site and a jekyll blog, both hosted on GitHub using GitHub pages. I am using [soulroll jekyll BootStrap 4](https://github.com/soulroll/jekyll-bootstrap-4) as a template. 

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
