Learning [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) while building my jekyll blog. The benefits using SASS over CSS [Cascading Style Sheets](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ "CSS"). CSS a controls the style for the presentation of Web pages within HTML it includes colors, layout, and fonts. This is fine for small apps however once the app becomes bigger and more dev are working on it becomes unwieldy also makes sense to be able to split a large css file into partials and then import those partials compile then into a main css file.
