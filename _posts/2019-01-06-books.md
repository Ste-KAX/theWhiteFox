<p>This year in these 12 months. I am going to read six books and maybe more. Currently I am reading Problem Solving 101 A Simple Book for Smart People during my train ride to and from work. The rest I read and write out the code on my small plastic laptop with the latest version of Ubuntu - 18.04 LTS “Bionic Beaver” with VSCode to view and debug and CLI Terminator to build out.</p>

## These are the six that I am reading
