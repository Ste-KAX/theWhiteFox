<p>This year in these 12 months, I am going to read six books and maybe more. On my train ride to and from work, I am reading [You Dont Know JS up & going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/up%20%26%20going "You Dont Know JS") & when I am want to change up I read CSS Master. The rest I read and write out the code on my small white plastic laptop with the latest version of Ubuntu - 18.04 LTS “Bionic Beaver”. VSCode to write / view / debug and <a href="https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html">GNOME Terminator</a> is my CLI.</p>
